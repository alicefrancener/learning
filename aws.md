# AWS ☁️

- Regions are geographic locations worldwide where AWS hosts its data centers. Inside every Region is a cluster of Availability Zones (AZ). An AZ consists of one or more data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity.
- Choose the Right AWS Region:
  - Latency. If your application is sensitive to latency, choose a Region that is close to your user base. This helps prevent long wait times for your customers.
  - Price. Due to the local economy and the physical nature of operating data centers, prices may vary from one Region to another.  
  - Service availability. Some services may not be available in some Regions.
  - Data compliance. Enterprise companies often need to comply with regulations that require customer data to be stored in a specific geographic territory.
