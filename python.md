- Single Leading Underscore: `_var`
  - convention
  - weak "internal use" indicator
  - impact how names get imported from modules (`from M import *` does not import objects whose name starts with an underscore)
- Single Trailing Underscore: `var_`
  - used by convention to avoid conflicts with Python keyword (`class_`)
- Double Leading Underscore: `__var`
  - when naming a class attribute, invokes name mangling (inside class `FooBar`, `__boo` becomes `_FooBar__boo`)
- Double Leading and Trailing Underscore: `__var__`
  - ‚Äúmagic‚Äù objects or attributes that live in user-controlled namespaces
  - name mangling is not applied if a name starts and ends with double underscores
  - called "dunders" (double underscore)
- Single Underscore: _
  - used as a name for temporary or insignificant variable
  - the resulto of the last expression in a Python REPL
